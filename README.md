Sorting
=======

Playing around with different sorting algorithms

based on an STL like design:
 -> takes only iterators as arguments
 -> tested on vectors only 
 -> should also work on lists and arrays.
 
 Radix sort is nice but only works on unsigned integer types
 
 Try to find some more to implement, is it possible to beat STL for general (non-radix) sorts?

To implement:
 - heap 
 - shell 
 - bogo (?)
 - comb
 - bucket (related to radix)
 - counting
 - cocktail
 - tim
